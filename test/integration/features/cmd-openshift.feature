Feature: Openshift commands
Commands "minishift openshift [sub-command]" are used for interaction with Openshift
cluster in VM provided by Minishift.

  Scenario: Trying service command when Minishift is not running
     Given Minishift has state "Does Not Exist"
      When executing "minishift openshift service list" succeeds
      Then stdout should contain
       """
       Running this command requires an existing 'minishift' VM, but no VM is defined.
       """

  Scenario: Minishift start
  Minishift must be started in order to interact with OpenShift via "minishift openshift" command

     Given Minishift has state "Does Not Exist"
       And image caching is disabled
      When executing "minishift start" succeeds

  Scenario: Service list sub-command
     Given Minishift has state "Running"
      When executing "minishift openshift service list" succeeds
      Then stdout should contain "docker-registry"
       And stdout should contain "kubernetes"
       And stdout should contain "router"

  Scenario: Restarting the OpenShift cluster
  Note: This step is based on observation and might be unstable in some environments. It checks for the time when container
        finished last time. When container is new and had never finished then this time value is set to 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z.
        On restart of OpenShift cluster containers are terminated, which sets FinishedAt to actual time. This value persist
        after next start of container.
     Given stdout of command "minishift ssh -- "docker inspect --format={{.State.FinishedAt}} origin"" is equal to "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"
      When executing "minishift openshift restart" succeeds
      Then stdout should contain "Restarting OpenShift"
       And stdout of command "minishift ssh -- "docker inspect --format={{.State.FinishedAt}} origin"" is not equal to "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"

  Scenario: User deploys nodejs example application from OpenShift repository
     Given user waited "30" seconds
      When executing "oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex -l name=myapp" succeeds
      Then stdout should contain
       """
       Run 'oc status' to view your app.
       """

  Scenario: Getting information about OpenShift and kubernetes versions
  Prints the current running OpenShift version to the standard output.
     Given Minishift has state "Running"
      When executing "minishift openshift version" succeeds
      Then stdout should match
       """

  Scenario: Getting address of internal docker registry
  Prints the host name and port number of the OpenShift registry to the standard output.
     Given Minishift has state "Running"
      When executing "minishift openshift registry" succeeds
      Then stdout should be valid IP with port number

  Scenario: Getting existing service without route
      When executing "minishift openshift service nodejs-ex" succeeds
      Then stdout should contain "nodejs-ex"

  Scenario: Getting non-existing service
  If service does not exist, user gets an empty table.
      When executing "minishift openshift service not-present" succeeds
      Then stdout should not contain "not-present"

  Scenario: Getting service from non-existing namespace
      When executing "minishift openshift service nodejs-ex --namespace does-not-exist" fails
      Then stderr should contain "Namespace 'does-not-exist' doesn't exist"

  Scenario: Forgotten service name
      When executing "minishift openshift service --namespace myapp" fails
      Then stderr should contain "You must specify the name of the service."

  Scenario: User creates route to the service
      When executing "oc expose svc/nodejs-ex" succeeds
      Then stdout should contain
       """
       route "nodejs-ex" exposed

  Scenario: Getting URL of service using --url flag
      When executing "minishift openshift service nodejs-ex --url" succeeds
      Then stdout should be valid URL

  Scenario: Seeing configuration of OpenShift master
  Minishift openshift config view prints YAML configuration of OpenShift cluster.
  Note: --target=master is default value for minishift openshift config command
      When executing "minishift openshift config view" succeeds
      Then stdout should be valid YAML

  Scenario: Seeing configuration of OpenShift node
      When executing "minishift openshift config view --target node" succeeds
      Then stdout should be valid YAML

  Scenario: Setting configuration on OpenShift master

      Then stdout should contain "Patching OpenShift configuration"
      When executing "minishift openshift config view" succeeds
      Then stdout is YAML which contains key "assetConfig.logoutURL" with value matching "http://www\.minishift\.io"

  Scenario: Deleting the Minishift instance
     Given Minishift has state "Running"
      When executing "minishift delete --force" succeeds
      Then Minishift should have state "Does Not Exist"
