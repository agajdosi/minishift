Feature: xpaas add-on
Xpaas add-on imports xPaaS templates and imagestreams,
which are then available in OpenShift to the user.

  Scenario: User enables the xpaas add-on
     When executing "minishift addons enable xpaas" succeeds
     Then stdout should contain "Add-on 'xpaas' enabled"

  Scenario: User starts Minishift
    Given Minishift has state "Does Not Exist"
      And image caching is disabled
     When executing "minishift start --memory 4GB" succeeds
     Then Minishift should have state "Running"
      And stdout should contain
      """
      XPaaS OpenShift imagestream and templates installed
      """

  Scenario: Ping to Github.com
     When executing "minishift ssh -- ping -c 10 github.com" succeeds

  Scenario: Edit hosts
     When executing "minishift ssh -- "echo '192.30.253.112 github.com' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts"" succeeds

  Scenario: Ping to Github.com after hosts
     When executing "minishift ssh -- ping -c 10 github.com" succeeds

  Scenario Outline: User deploys, checks out and deletes several templates from XpaaS imagestream
   Given Minishift has state "Running"
    When executing "oc new-app <template-name>" succeeds
     And executing "oc set probe dc/<service-name> --readiness --get-url=http://:8080<http-endpoint>" succeeds
     And service "<service-name>" rollout successfully within "1200" seconds
    Then with up to "10" retries with wait period of "500ms" the "body" of HTTP request to "<http-endpoint>" of service "<service-name>" in namespace "myproject" contains "<expected-hello>"
     And with up to "10" retries with wait period of "500ms" the "status code" of HTTP request to "<http-endpoint>" of service "<service-name>" in namespace "myproject" is equal to "200"
     And executing "oc delete all --all" succeeds

  Examples: Required information to test the templates
    | template-name           | service-name   | http-endpoint | expected-hello                        |

  Scenario: User deletes Minishift
     When executing "minishift delete --force" succeeds
     Then Minishift should have state "Does Not Exist"
